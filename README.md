# Band Protocol Assignment

This project is a Band Protocol assignment that includes three problems. The first two are coding algorithm questions, and the last one is a system design question. I have written the code to solve the first two problems in Go language due to its efficiency, which are well-suited for algorithmic challenges. The last problem involves designing a system, for which I have provided detailed diagrams and explanations. Below is the structure of the project:

## Problem 1: Boss Baby's Revenge

Boss Baby is being teased by kids who shoot water guns at his house. He shoots back only if they shoot first. Your task is to check if Boss Baby has revenged every shot aimed at him at least once and hasn't initiated any shooting himself. Return "Good boy" if he meets these conditions, otherwise return "Bad boy".

## Problem 2: Superman's Chicken Rescue

In a one-dimensional world, Superman needs to protect chickens from a heavy rainstorm using a roof of limited length. Given the positions of chickens and the length of the roof Superman can carry, determine the maximum number of chickens Superman can protect.

## Problem 3: Design oracle system

The task is to design a versatile oracle system that retrieves and transmits real-time cryptocurrency prices from various sources, including Decentralized Exchanges, Centralized Exchanges, and Price Aggregator Services. The system should support multiple clients with diverse asset requirements, allowing them to seamlessly query and send cryptocurrency prices through this service.
